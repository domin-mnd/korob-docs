# Usage

Korob CLI comes with a set of commands to work with typescript/javascript projects.
It is designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible.
Each of the command serves its own purpose however all of them share same prepare functionality.

## Config generation

Korob aims to be environment-friendly and this is why it will create additional configuration files
in order to properly work with the IDE/text editor of your choice:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="node_modules" open={false} />
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
  <FileTree.File name=".prettierignore" active />
  <FileTree.File name=".prettierrc.json" active />
  <FileTree.File name="biome.json" active />
  <FileTree.File name="korob.config.ts" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="package-lock.json" />
</FileTree>

Additionally make sure to add those files to `.gitignore`. This is due to the fact that those files are created for the development purposes only.

Adding following files to ignore list is usually handled by `korob init` but for the sake of manual installation here's the snippet:

```bash copy filename=".gitignore"
# Korob
dist
.korob
.prettierrc.json
.prettierignore
biome.json
```

## Editor integration

Korob was made to be used along with extensions for your favorite editor. Here's a list of recommended extensions:

- Biome [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) or [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22761-biome) extension for formatting and linting
- Prettier [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) or [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier) extension for fallback formatting
- Vitest [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vitest.explorer) extension for testing

## Commands

Besides the config generation there's, of course, more functionality for every command. Here's a short command description:

- `korob build` - Build the project into a bundle taking the `config.build.entry` entry path
- `korob dev` - Start a development server with hot reloading
- `korob format` - Format the project using biome and prettier as fallback
- `korob init` - Initialize existing workspace
- `korob lint` - Lint the project using biome and prettier as fallback
- `korob start [PATH]` - Execute javascript/typescript file
- `korob test` - Test all \*.test.js/ts files via vitest

For more information on commands, head to the corresponding [commands](/commands) section:

<Callout type="info">
  None of the CLI commands but `korob start` take arguments. This is because the CLI is designed to be as
  simple as possible. The only source of configuration is `"korob"` key in `package.json` or
  `korob.config.js`/`korob.config.ts`.
