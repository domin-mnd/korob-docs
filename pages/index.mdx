# Overview

![Comparison](/getting-started.png)

Javascript world is an overwhelmengly big ecosystem with a lot of libraries and tools to choose from. It's hard to keep up with all the new stuff that are being released every day. Configuring a new project can be a daunting task. For this reason, korob exists.

Korob is a simple tool to help you build apps and npm packages faster. It comes up with a set of tools and configurations that are commonly used in **modern** javascript projects to help formatting, linting, testing, building and deploying your code.

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Initialize

Start by initializing your existing project with korob:

```bash npm2yarn
npm exec korob init
```

<Callout type="info">
  Korob doesn't come up with project creation command, only initialization. This is intended by design. You
  can use any boilerplate template you like to create your project.
</Callout>

### Add scripts

After initializing, you can add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "korob build",
    "format": "korob format",
    "lint": "korob lint",
    "test": "korob test",
    "start": "korob start"
  }
}
```

These scripts will help you working with your project. You're free to add the only scripts you need. Korob is aimed to be flexible with any workspace.

### Adjust configuration

After executing the initialization command, you can adjust `korob.config.ts` (created if `korob` is installed) to your needs:

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="korob.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "korob";

export default defineConfig({
  start: {
    entry: "src/main.ts",
  },
  build: {
    minify: false,
    dts: false,
  },
  diagnostics: {
    biome: {
      extends: ["@domin-mnd/config/biome"],
    },
  },
});
```

</Steps>
